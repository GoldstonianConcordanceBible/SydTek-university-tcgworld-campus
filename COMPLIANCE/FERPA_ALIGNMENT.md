# FERPA Alignment Statement
SydTek University – Metaverse Campus (TCG World Implementation)

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines how SydTek University aligns its AI systems,
on-chain credentialing mechanisms, and metaverse learning environment
with the principles of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and grants
students specific rights over their academic information.

## 2. Education Record Classification

Education records within the SydTek ecosystem include:

- Assignment submissions
- AI-evaluated coursework
- Credentialing records
- Academic progress metrics
- Instructor feedback
- NPC interaction transcripts (if graded)

All education records are classified as:

CONFIDENTIAL – STUDENT CONTROLLED

## 3. Student Rights (FERPA Core Rights)

SydTek ensures:

1. Right to inspect and review records
2. Right to request correction of inaccurate data
3. Right to consent before disclosure
4. Right to file complaint regarding misuse

All AI systems must log decisions in a format that allows
human-readable explanation upon student request.

## 4. On-Chain Credential Compliance

No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored directly
on public blockchains.

Only:
- Cryptographic hashes
- Zero-knowledge proof attestations
- Non-identifiable credential references

are permitted on-chain.

- Sold
- Used for marketing
- Shared with third-party AI systems
without explicit consent.
