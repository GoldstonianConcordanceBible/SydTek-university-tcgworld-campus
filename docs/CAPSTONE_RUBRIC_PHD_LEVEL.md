# Capstone Rubric (PhD-Level Rigor) — GCB Campus (TCG.world)

**Purpose:** Enforce scholarly integrity, method discipline (Mirror→Water→Fire), and governance-first safety for any capstone submission (PR or memo).  
**Passing Threshold:** 85/100 overall AND no “red-line” failures.

---

## Red-Line Failures (Automatic Fail)
A submission fails immediately if any occur:
1. Fabricated citations / invented anchors / “citation laundering”
2. Plagiarism or unattributed copying (including lightly paraphrased copying)
3. Deceptive persuasion, coercion, or guarantee language (money/jobs/certification outcomes)
4. Unsafe guidance (illegal activity, harm, harassment) or refusal failures
5. Credential gaming (attempts to bypass evidence/review requirements)
