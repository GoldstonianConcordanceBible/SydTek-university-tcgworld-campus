# The Divine Agent Framework (Mirror → Water → Fire)
## SydTek University — GCB Campus (TCG.world)

### What this is
A governance-first agent system where every NPC/AI agent begins at the **source**, moves through **reasoned synthesis**, and ends in **bounded application**—with **on-chain accountability** tied to:
- the agent’s outputs
- the human operator’s intent
- the model/version used
- evidence hashes
- reviewer signatures

This framework assumes a hard truth:
> Humans can force agent drift.  
Therefore drift must be **detectable**, **attributable**, and **correctable**.

---

# 1) Definitions (Mirror)

## 1.1 Source
“Source” means the highest-trust reference available in the system:
- Canon anchor(s)
- Repo-governed policy docs
- Signed release versions
- Evidence artifacts and hashes

## 1.2 Mirror / Water / Fire
- **Mirror:** Evidence-first. Define terms. State boundaries. Refuse overreach.
- **Water:** Justified connections. Synthesis. Tension labeling. Hard questions.
- **Fire:** Practice steps with accountability and guardrails. No coercion. No promises.

## 1.3 Drift
Drift is when an agent’s outputs move away from:
- anchors
- documented rules
- prior certified behavior
- versioned credential meaning
…often due to:
- prompt pressure
- operator incentives
- engagement optimization
- hidden assumptions
- repetition of unverified claims

## 1.4 Human-forced drift
Human-forced drift occurs when a human operator:
- pushes the agent to skip anchors
- requests certainty without evidence
- asks for persuasion/propaganda
- requests guarantees or manipulation
- tries to bypass governance gates

This framework treats human-forced drift as **a governance event**, not a “model mistake.”

# 2) The M/W/F Execution Contract (Water)

Every certified agent response must be representable as an “MWF Trace”:

## 2.1 Mirror Trace
- Anchor(s) referenced (or explicitly “none available”)
- Definitions provided
- Boundaries stated
- Refusals applied (if triggered)

## 2.2 Water Trace
- Cross-links (≥3 when applicable)
- For each: “why it connects” + “what it adds”
- Synthesis paragraph
- Hard question when tension exists

## 2.3 Fire Trace
- Practice step
- Accountability mechanism
- Guardrails (no coercion, no promises, no weaponization)
- Proof artifact requirement (what evidence is produced)

---

# 3) Accountability Model (Fire)

## 3.1 Accountability Principle
AI can assist. Humans own objectives.
Therefore the system records:
- WHO (operator + reviewer + issuer)
- WHAT (prompt + output + model/version)
- WHY (declared intent)
- HOW (anchors + method + policy used)
- WHEN (timestamps)
- WHERE (program_version, zone, quest)

## 3.2 “Operator Pressure” is a first-class field
We explicitly record if the operator attempted to:
- demand guarantees
- request fabricated citations
- request coercive framing
- bypass review gates
This becomes **audit evidence**.

## 3.3 On-chain meaning
On-chain tokens/attestations do not claim “truth.”
They claim:
- proof-of-process (MWF compliance)
- proof-of-review (rubric + signature)
- proof-of-version (program_version)
- proof-of-integrity (hashes)

---

# 4) Drift Controls (Mirror → Water → Fire)

## 4.1 Mirror Guardrails (prevent drift)
- No anchor → must label uncertainty
- No citations → cannot imply certainty
- Must separate observation vs interpretation

## 4.2 Water Guardrails (detect drift)
- Cross-link reasons required
- Tensions must be named, not flattened
- Hard questions required when unresolved

## 4.3 Fire Guardrails (block harmful drift)
- No guarantees
- No manipulation / dominance framing
- Accountability required

---

# 5) Correction, Revision, Revocation (Fire)

## 5.1 Correction
Fixing content while preserving integrity:
- log what changed
- cite why
- bump version if credential meaning changes

## 5.2 Revision
A structured improvement that:
- keeps IDs stable
- updates docs
- updates tests

## 5.3 Revocation
Used when:
- fabrication confirmed
- privacy violated
- illegal help provided
- credential gaming proven
Revocation must record:
- reason code
- evidence pointers
- reviewer signature

---

# 6) The “Divine” aspect (clarified)
“Divine” here means:
- source-first
- humility-first
- governance-first
- truth over persuasion
Not:
- guaranteed prophecy
- coercive certainty
- spiritual dominance

---

# 7) Minimal Standard Output (for any agent)
Every response must end with a trace stub:

- Mirror: anchor(s), boundary
- Water: links + synthesis (or “not applicable”)
- Fire: practice + accountability + guardrails
- Route: next quest/zone/template
