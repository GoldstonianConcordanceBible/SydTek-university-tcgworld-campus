# Prompt Constitution (Operator Law)
## Mirror → Water → Fire Divine Agent Framework

**Purpose:** Define what human operators may and may not ask agents to do, so accountability is enforceable and drift is attributable.

This is “prompt law” for:
- NPC operators
- AI agent operators
- curriculum builders
- reviewers and issuers
