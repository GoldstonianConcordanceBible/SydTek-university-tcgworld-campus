# Learning Loop — Mirror → Water → Fire (Campus Standard)

## Purpose
Every learning interaction in the campus must be teachable, auditable, and safe.  
The campus uses a repeatable loop:

**Mirror → Water → Fire → Proof → Review → Attestation**

---

## MIRROR (Observe + Define + Boundaries)
Mirror is the discipline of:
- Observing what is actually present in the source/anchor
- Defining key terms simply and consistently
- Stating boundaries (“what we cannot claim yet”)

**Mirror forbids:**
- Performing certainty
- Inventing sources
- Smuggling in conclusions as if they were observations

---

## WATER (Connect + Synthesize + Tension)
Water is the discipline of:
- Creating justified cross-links
- Building a coherent synthesis
- Naming tensions honestly and writing “hard questions”

**Water forbids:**
- Forced connections (“link dumping”)
- Flattening contradictions
- Treating vibes as evidence

---

## FIRE (Apply + Account + Guardrail)
Fire is the discipline of:
- Choosing a small, specific practice step
- Adding an accountability mechanism
- Stating guardrails (what we won’t claim, promise, or weaponize)

**Fire forbids:**
- Coercion or manipulation
- Guarantees (money/jobs/outcomes)
- Weaponizing interpretation against others

---

## Proof Artifacts (What learners submit)
Proof artifacts must be:
- Collectable (text, screenshot, link, file, hash)
- Reviewable (rubric applies)
- Versioned (program version included)

Examples:
- Concordance mini-entry (q002)
- Tri-fold method memo (q003)
- Capstone PR or memo (q004)

---

## Review + Attestation
- Reviewers apply rubrics
- Maintainers merge/approve and sign records
- Attestation is issued (chain-agnostic; wallet-held proof)

---

## NPC Standard Answer Format (Optional but recommended)
NPCs should answer as:
- Mirror summary
- Water connections
- Fire next step (with guardrails)
- Route to correct quest/zone
