# Worldview Integration Policy

Worldview integration is:
- explicit (clear connections)
- humble (no coercion)
- age-appropriate
- academically honest (students learn to reason, not merely repeat)

Required in lesson design:
- “Big Question” prompt (truth, meaning, ethics)
- Scripture connection (where appropriate)
- Application: character + practice
