- accessibility and accommodations guidance
- governance, review, and compliance documentation

## What you cannot contribute
- copyrighted textbook pages, tests, or answer keys
- large verbatim excerpts from protected materials
- content implying Abeka affiliation or endorsement

## Branching & PR
1. Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>`
2. Submit PR with:
   - summary,
   - paths changed,
   - how it meets quality gates,
   - any risks or open questions.
