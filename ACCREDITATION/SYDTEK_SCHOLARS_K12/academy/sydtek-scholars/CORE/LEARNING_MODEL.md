# Learning Model (Mirror → Water → Fire)

## Mirror (Identity + Truth + Comprehension)
- reading comprehension, narration, memory
- reflection prompts that build character and clarity
- “say what you know” skill: summarize, define, explain

## Water (Practice + Fluency)
- daily drills, spaced repetition, cumulative review
- short practice cycles with fast feedback
- skill ladders and mastery checks

## Fire (Application + Creation + Service)
- projects, capstones, presentations
- real-world tasks: write, build, measure, debate, serve
- portfolio artifacts and performance rubrics

## Non-negotiables
- Parent-operable instructions
- Evidence-based mastery decisions
- Respectful, age-appropriate formation
