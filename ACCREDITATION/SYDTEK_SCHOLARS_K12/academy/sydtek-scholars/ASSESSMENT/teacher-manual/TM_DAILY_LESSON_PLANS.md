# Teacher Manual — Daily Lesson Plan Template (Algebra I)

## Daily Plan (45–75 minutes)
1. Warm-up (5–10m)
2. Mini-lesson (10–15m)
3. Guided practice (15–20m)
4. Independent practice (15–25m)
5. Exit ticket (3–5m)
6. Corrections (as needed)

## Exit Ticket Rules
- 2 skill items + 1 explain-your-step item
- If exit ticket < 2/3 correct, assign “same-day fix” set (3–5 items)

## Correction Routine (non-shaming)
- Identify error type
- Rewrite correct solution with one sentence explaining the fix
