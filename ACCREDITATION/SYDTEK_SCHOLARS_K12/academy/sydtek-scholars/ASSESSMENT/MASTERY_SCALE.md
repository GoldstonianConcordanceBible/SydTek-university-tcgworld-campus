# Mastery Scale (SydTek Scholars)

## Level 4: Exceeds
Explains clearly, transfers to new situations, minimal help.

## Level 3: Meets
Accurate and independent on grade-level tasks.

## Level 2: Developing
Partly correct; needs prompts, re-teaching, or extra practice.

## Level 1: Beginning
Not yet; needs guided instruction and foundational rebuilding.

## Rule
Promotion is based on **evidence**, not time:
- 2–3 strong samples + 1 check = Level 3
- repeated support needed = Level 2
