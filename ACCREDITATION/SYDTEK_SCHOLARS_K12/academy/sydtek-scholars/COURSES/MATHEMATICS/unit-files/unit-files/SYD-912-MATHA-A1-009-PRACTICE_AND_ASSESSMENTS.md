# B) Practice Set 1 — Solve by Graphing (Compute Intersection Exactly)

Solve each system by finding the intersection point (you may also solve algebraically to confirm).

1) y = x + 1  
   y = 3x - 3

2) y = 2x + 4  
   y = -x + 1

3) y = -x + 6

   y = -3x + 2 (identify solution type)

### Answer Key
1) x+1 = 3x-3 → 4 = 2x → x=2, y=3 → (2,3)  
2) 2x+4 = -x+1 → 3x=-3 → x=-1, y=2 → (-1,2)  
3) -x+6 = x-2 → 8=2x → x=4, y=2 → (4,2)  
4) 0.5x+2 = -0.5x+4 → x=2, y=3 → (2,3)

Let a = adult, s = student.  
Write system and solve.

a + s = 11  
7a + 4s = 62  
Solve: a=6, s=5

Let x and y be the numbers.

**Key:**

Let x = liters of 10%, y = liters of 30%.

**Key:**  
x + y = 10  
0.10x + 0.30y = 0.20(10)=2

## Problem 4 (Phone plan)
Plan A: $25 plus $5 per GB. Plan B: $10 plus $8 per GB.  
At what GB are the costs equal? Let g = GB, C = cost.

**Key:**  
C = 25 + 5g  
C = 10 + 8g  
Set equal: 25 + 5g = 10 + 8g → 15 = 3g → g = 5, cost = 50
