# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-011 — Polynomials & Factoring
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Focus:** polynomial operations, GCF factoring, trinomial factoring

## Objectives
- Add/subtract polynomials accurately.
- Multiply monomial × polynomial.
- Factor out GCF.
- Factor trinomials of the form x^2 + bx + c.
- Use factoring as a strategy to solve problems (prep for Unit 012).

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain factoring as “undoing distribution.”
- **Water:** Daily factoring practice with strategy notes.
- **Fire:** Build a factoring “decision tree” + teach it (mini-lesson).

## Lesson Flow (15 days)
**Days 1–2:** Polynomial vocabulary + add/subtract  
**Days 3–4:** Multiply monomial × polynomial  
**Days 5–6:** Factor GCF  
**Day 7:** Quiz J1 + corrections  
**Days 8–10:** Factor trinomials (x^2 + bx + c)  
**Day 11:** Mixed practice + error analysis  
**Day 12:** Review  
**Day 13:** Summative  
**Days 14–15:** Portfolio artifact P07 build + reflection

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Operations (10) — target ≥ 9/10
- **FC2:** GCF factoring (10) — target ≥ 9/10
- **FC3:** Trinomials (12) — target ≥ 10/12

## Summative
- Test J: operations + factoring + error analysis  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND correct method selection ≥ 80%.

## Accommodations
- Use area/box model for trinomials.
- Provide factoring checklist (GCF first, then trinomial).

## Enrichment
- Factor trinomials with leading coefficient ≠ 1 (challenge set).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: forgetting to factor out a negative GCF when helpful.
- Quick win: always check factoring by multiplying back.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test J + Artifact P07 + one page of “strategy notes.”
