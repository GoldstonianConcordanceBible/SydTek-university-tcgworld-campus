# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-002 — Variables, Expressions, and Properties
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** simplify expressions, distributive property, translating words to algebra

## Objectives
- Identify terms, coefficients, constants, and like terms.
- Simplify expressions by combining like terms (including negatives).
- Use the distributive property to expand and simplify.
- Translate verbal phrases into algebraic expressions.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Name the “parts” of an expression and explain what each part means.
- **Water:** Daily simplify drills (combine like terms + distribution).
- **Fire:** Build expressions from real-life contexts (prices, distance, time) and simplify.

## Materials
- Notebook, pencil
- Optional: highlighters (color-code like terms)

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Vocabulary + like terms  
**Day 2:** Combine like terms (including negatives)  
**Day 3:** Distributive property (expand)  
**Day 4:** Multi-step simplify (distribute then combine)  
**Day 5:** Quiz A (formative) + corrections

**Day 6:** Translating verbal phrases to expressions  
**Day 7:** Translate + simplify (mixed)  
**Day 8:** Error analysis: fix 8 incorrect simplifications  
**Day 9:** Review stations (like terms / distribute / translate)  
**Day 10:** Summative + portfolio artifact P01

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Like terms (15) — target ≥ 13/15
- **FC2:** Distribute (15) — target ≥ 13/15
- **FC3:** Translate (10) — target ≥ 8/10

## Summative
- Test A: simplify + translate + error analysis (approx 25 items)  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% overall AND ≥ 80% on translation items.

## Accommodations
- Color-code like terms; provide a “distribute checklist.”
- Sentence frames for translation (e.g., “more than” = +, “less than” flips order).

## Enrichment
- Introduce factoring as “reverse distribution” with simple examples.

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: translating “5 less than x” as 5 − x instead of x − 5.
- Quick win: require students to circle operation words in verbal phrases.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test A + corrected error-analysis sheet + Artifact P01.
- Retake path: small targeted set (10) then an alternate Test A.
