# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-006 — Linear Functions: Slope & Rate of Change
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** slope computation and meaning

## Objectives
- Compute slope from a graph, table, and two points.
- Interpret slope as rate of change with units.
- Recognize positive/negative/zero/undefined slope patterns.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain slope as “change in y per 1 change in x.”
- **Water:** Daily slope drills with interpretation.
- **Fire:** Collect a simple data set and interpret the slope as a real rate.

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Slope as rise/run (graph)  
**Day 2:** Slope from two points  
**Day 3:** Slope from tables  
**Day 4:** Interpreting slope in context (units)  
**Day 5:** Quiz E1 + corrections

**Day 6:** Special slopes (0, undefined)  
**Day 7:** Compare slopes (steepness)  
**Day 8:** Error analysis: slope mistakes  
**Day 9:** Mini-lab: rate data collection  
**Day 10:** Summative

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Compute slope (12) — target ≥ 10/12
- **FC2:** Interpret slope (6) — target ≥ 5/6

## Summative
- Test E: compute + interpret + error analysis  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND interpretation items ≥ 80%.

## Accommodations
- Provide a slope template: (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1).
- Use graph paper for clarity.

## Enrichment
- Compare proportional vs non-proportional relationships (through origin vs not).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: mixing up x and y differences.
- Quick win: require labeling points as (x1,y1), (x2,y2) before computing.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test E + lab note page (data + slope interpretation).
