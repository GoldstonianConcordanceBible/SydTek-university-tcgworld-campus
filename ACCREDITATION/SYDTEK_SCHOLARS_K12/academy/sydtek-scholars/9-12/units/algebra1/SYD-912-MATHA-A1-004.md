# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-004 — Inequalities & Compound Inequalities
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** solving inequalities, graphing, modeling constraints

## Objectives
- Solve and graph one-variable inequalities.
- Solve compound inequalities (AND/OR) and graph solutions.
- Model real constraints using inequalities.
- Explain why multiplying/dividing by a negative flips the inequality.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain the “flip” rule with a number-line reasoning example.
- **Water:** Solve + graph daily.
- **Fire:** Build a simple budget/time constraint model and present it.

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Inequality symbols + number line graphing  
**Day 2:** Solve inequalities (add/sub)  
**Day 3:** Solve inequalities (mult/div)  
**Day 4:** Negative multiplier and sign flip (deep practice)  
**Day 5:** Quiz C1 + corrections

**Day 6:** Compound inequalities (AND)  
**Day 7:** Compound inequalities (OR)  
**Day 8:** Word problems → inequalities  
**Day 9:** Review + mixed practice  
**Day 10:** Summative + portfolio artifact P03

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Solve + graph (12) — target ≥ 10/12
- **FC2:** Compound (10) — target ≥ 8/10
- **FC3:** Word models (6) — target ≥ 5/6

## Summative
- Test C: solve, graph, and model (includes 3 word problems)  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND graphs accurate on ≥ 90% of graph items.

## Accommodations
- Provide sign-flip reminder card.
- Use “test point” method to verify solution sets.

## Enrichment
- Interval notation and set-builder notation for solution sets.

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: forgetting open vs closed circles.
- Quick win: have student restate the inequality in words after solving.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test C + modeling artifact + a corrected “flip rule” explanation.
