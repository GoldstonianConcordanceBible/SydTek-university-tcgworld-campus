# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-010 — Exponents & Scientific Notation
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** exponent rules, zero/negative exponents, scientific notation applications

## Objectives
- Simplify expressions using exponent rules (product, quotient, power).
- Evaluate zero and negative exponents.
- Convert between standard and scientific notation.
- Compute using scientific notation (multiply/divide).

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain exponent meaning as repeated multiplication (and how rules follow).
- **Water:** Rule drills + “spot the rule” practice.
- **Fire:** Big/Small Numbers Lab (space/biology contexts) with a short report (P06).

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Exponent meaning + powers  
**Day 2:** Product/quotient rules  
**Day 3:** Power rules  
**Day 4:** Zero/negative exponents  
**Day 5:** Quiz I1 + corrections

**Day 6:** Scientific notation conversions  
**Day 7:** Scientific notation operations  
**Day 8:** Mixed practice + error analysis  
**Day 9:** Lab/report build (P06)  
**Day 10:** Summative

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Exponent rules (15) — target ≥ 13/15
- **FC2:** Sci notation convert/compute (10) — target ≥ 8/10

## Summative
- Test I: simplify + apply + context problems  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND conversions accurate ≥ 90%.

## Accommodations
- Provide a rule chart; limit to one rule at a time early.
- Use step-by-step conversion boxes.

## Enrichment
- Compare scientific notation efficiency; introduce engineering notation (optional).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: adding exponents when you should multiply powers.
- Quick win: require students to name the rule used on early assignments.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test I + Lab Report P06 + corrected error-analysis sheet.
