# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-003 — One-Step & Multi-Step Linear Equations
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** solving linear equations, checking solutions, special cases

## Objectives
- Solve one-step and multi-step linear equations.
- Solve equations with variables on both sides.
- Identify no-solution and infinitely-many-solution cases.
- Verify solutions by substitution.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain “equation = balance” and why inverse operations work.
- **Water:** Daily solve-and-check routines.
- **Fire:** Create a 6-equation “code lock” (solutions reveal a code) + explain steps.

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** One-step equations (add/sub) + checking  
**Day 2:** One-step equations (mult/div) + checking  
**Day 3:** Multi-step equations (combine like terms)  
**Day 4:** Multi-step equations (distribute + combine)  
**Day 5:** Quiz B (formative) + corrections

**Day 6:** Variables on both sides  
**Day 7:** Special cases (no solution / infinite solutions)  
**Day 8:** Mixed practice + word equation setup (simple)  
**Day 9:** Review + “show your work” focus  
**Day 10:** Summative + portfolio artifact P02

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** One-step (10) — target ≥ 9/10
- **FC2:** Multi-step (12) — target ≥ 10/12
- **FC3:** Both sides + special cases (10) — target ≥ 8/10

## Summative
- Test B: 18 problems + 2 reasoning items  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND correct classification of special cases.

## Accommodations
- Use balance visuals; provide a step checklist.
- Permit “check by substitution” on all items.

## Enrichment
- Literal equations (solve for a variable) with simple formulas.

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: distributing incorrectly across subtraction.
- Quick win: insist on one operation per line (clean algebra).

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test B + code-lock artifact + corrections.
- If <85%: assign targeted re-teach set by error type, then alternate test.
