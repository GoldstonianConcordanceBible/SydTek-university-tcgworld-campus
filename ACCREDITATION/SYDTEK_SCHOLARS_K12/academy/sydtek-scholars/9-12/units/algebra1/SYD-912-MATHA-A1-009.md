# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-009 — Systems of Linear Equations
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Focus:** graphing, substitution, elimination, modeling

## Objectives
- Solve systems by graphing, substitution, and elimination.
- Identify solution types: one solution, no solution, infinitely many.
- Write systems from word problems and interpret solutions.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain what an intersection represents in the real world.
- **Water:** Daily mixed-method system solving with method choice.
- **Fire:** Model a real situation with a system and defend the method used.

## Lesson Flow (15 days)
**Days 1–2:** Systems concept + solve by graphing  
**Days 3–4:** Substitution method  
**Days 5–6:** Elimination method  
**Day 7:** Quiz H1 + corrections  
**Day 8:** Special cases (parallel/same line)  
**Days 9–10:** Word problems → systems  
**Day 11:** Choose method efficiency practice  
**Day 12:** Review  
**Day 13:** Summative  
**Days 14–15:** Portfolio artifact P05 build + defense

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Graphing (6) — target ≥ 5/6
- **FC2:** Substitution (8) — target ≥ 7/8
- **FC3:** Elimination (8) — target ≥ 7/8
- **FC4:** Modeling (4) — target ≥ 3/4

## Summative
- Test H: mixed methods + modeling items  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND correct interpretation of solution type.

## Accommodations
- Allow method choice; provide elimination scaffolds (align, multiply, add/subtract).
- Encourage check by substitution.

## Enrichment
- Systems with parameters; analyze when solutions change.

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: arithmetic mistakes in elimination.
- Quick win: always rewrite both equations neatly aligned before elimination.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test H + Artifact P05 + a written method-defense paragraph.
