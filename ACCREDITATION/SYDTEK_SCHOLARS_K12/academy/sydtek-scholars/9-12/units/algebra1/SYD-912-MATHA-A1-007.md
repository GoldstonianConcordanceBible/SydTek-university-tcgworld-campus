# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-007 — Linear Equations: Forms & Graphing
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Focus:** y=mx+b, standard form, point-slope, graphing lines

## Objectives
- Graph lines in slope-intercept form y = mx + b.
- Convert between standard form and slope-intercept form.
- Use point-slope form to write an equation from a point and slope.
- Identify intercepts and interpret them in context.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Connect m and b to real meaning (rate + starting value).
- **Water:** Graph a line daily using multiple methods.
- **Fire:** Create a “Line Gallery”: 6 real-world line stories with graphs.

## Lesson Flow (15 days)
**Days 1–2:** y=mx+b meaning + graphing  
**Day 3:** Find equation from graph (read m and b)  
**Days 4–5:** Standard form + intercepts  
**Day 6:** Convert forms (standard ↔ slope-intercept)  
**Day 7:** Quiz F1 + corrections  
**Days 8–9:** Point-slope form + writing equations from point+slope  
**Day 10:** From two points → slope → equation  
**Day 11:** Interpret intercepts in context  
**Day 12:** Mixed practice station rotation  
**Day 13:** Review + error analysis  
**Day 14:** Summative  
**Day 15:** Portfolio polish day (Line Gallery artifact optional add-on)

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Graph from y=mx+b (10) — target ≥ 9/10
- **FC2:** Convert forms (10) — target ≥ 8/10
- **FC3:** Write equation (8) — target ≥ 7/8

## Summative
- Test F: graph + convert + interpret  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND graphs accurate on ≥ 90% items.

## Accommodations
- Provide slope triangles; allow verification with 2 plotted points.
- Give conversion step guide for standard form.

## Enrichment
- Parallel/perpendicular slope relationships (challenge section).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: sign errors when solving for y.
- Quick win: “solve for y” should be written as a clean step-by-step chain.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test F + one annotated graph showing interpretation of m and b.
