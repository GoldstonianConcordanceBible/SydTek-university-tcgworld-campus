# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-008 — Linear Modeling & Scatter Plots
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** data, correlation, best-fit line, interpretation

## Objectives
- Create and interpret scatter plots.
- Describe correlation (positive/negative/none) and strength (informal).
- Estimate a line of best fit and interpret slope/intercept.
- Understand residuals at an introductory level (difference from prediction).

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain correlation vs causation in one paragraph.
- **Water:** Practice reading scatter plots and interpreting trend lines daily.
- **Fire:** Produce a short modeling report from a self-collected data set.

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Scatter plots + correlation language  
**Day 2:** Draw best-fit line by hand  
**Day 3:** Interpret slope/intercept in context  
**Day 4:** Predictions from the model + residual idea  
**Day 5:** Quiz G1 + corrections

**Day 6:** Compare two models (which fits better?)  
**Day 7:** Small project workday (data collection)  
**Day 8:** Draft modeling report  
**Day 9:** Review + practice  
**Day 10:** Summative

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Correlation ID (10) — target ≥ 9/10
- **FC2:** Interpret slope/intercept (6) — target ≥ 5/6

## Summative
- Test G: plot + model + interpret + short write-up  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND write-up meets rubric Level 3.

## Accommodations
- Provide pre-labeled axes templates.
- Use smaller data sets first (6–8 points).

## Enrichment
- Introduce regression on calculator/spreadsheet (optional) and compare to hand fit.

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: claiming causation from correlation.
- Quick win: require the sentence “This shows association, not proof of cause.”

## Recordkeeping
- Save modeling report draft + final + test.
