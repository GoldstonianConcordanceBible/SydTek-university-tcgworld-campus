# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-005 — Relations, Functions, and Representations
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Focus:** function concept, notation, and representations

## Objectives
- Determine whether a relation is a function (mapping, table, graph).
- Use function notation f(x) and evaluate at inputs.
- Connect tables, graphs, and equations as representations.

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Define function as “one input produces one output.”
- **Water:** Practice function tests + f(x) evaluation daily.
- **Fire:** Build a mini-project: pick a context and create a function model.

## Lesson Flow (10 days)
**Day 1:** Relations vs functions (tables/mappings)  
**Day 2:** Vertical line test (graphs)  
**Day 3:** Function notation and evaluation  
**Day 4:** Representations (table ↔ graph)  
**Day 5:** Quiz D1 + corrections

**Day 6:** Representations (equation ↔ table)  
**Day 7:** Domain/range in context  
**Day 8:** Mixed practice + error analysis  
**Day 9:** Project build (P04)  
**Day 10:** Summative

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Function or not? (12) — target ≥ 10/12
- **FC2:** Evaluate f(x) (12) — target ≥ 10/12

## Summative
- Test D: mixed representations + short response explanations  
**Mastery:** ≥ 85% AND correct function ID ≥ 90%.

## Accommodations
- Use mapping diagrams; guided vertical-line steps.
- Provide organized tables for input/output.

## Enrichment
- Restrict domain based on real constraints (e.g., time can’t be negative).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: confusing range with domain.
- Quick win: force “input → output” language for every function task.

## Recordkeeping
- Save Test D + Project P04 + one reflection paragraph.
