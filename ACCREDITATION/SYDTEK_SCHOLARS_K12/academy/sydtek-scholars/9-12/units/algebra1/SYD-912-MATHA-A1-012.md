# SYD-912-MATHA-A1-012 — Quadratics by Factoring & Applications
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Focus:** solving quadratics by factoring, zero product property, context interpretation, final project

## Objectives
- Solve quadratic equations by factoring.
- Apply the zero product property.
- Interpret solutions in context and identify extraneous/non-applicable solutions.
- Complete a cumulative final exam and a final modeling project (P08).

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- **Mirror:** Explain why “ab = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or b = 0” (zero product property).
- **Water:** Daily solve-by-factoring practice with checks.
- **Fire:** Final project: model a scenario and present reasoning + reflection.

## Lesson Flow (15 days)
**Days 1–2:** Quadratic forms + factoring review  
**Days 3–4:** Zero product property + solve by factoring  
**Day 5:** Applications (area models, simple projectile-style problems without graphic detail)  
**Day 6:** Quiz K1 + corrections  
**Days 7–9:** Mixed solving + applications + interpretation  
**Day 10:** Review stations (linear, systems, exponents, factoring, quadratics)  
**Day 11:** Final Exam (cumulative)  
**Days 12–14:** Final Project P08 build (model + report + reflection)  
**Day 15:** Defense/presentation + portfolio completion

## Formative Checks
- **FC1:** Solve by factoring (12) — target ≥ 10/12
- **FC2:** Applications/interpretation (6) — target ≥ 5/6

## Summative
- **Final Exam:** cumulative  
- **Final Project (P08):** modeling report + presentation using rubric  
**Mastery:** Exam ≥ 80% AND Project rubric Level 3 (Meets).

## Accommodations
- Provide factoring supports (box model, GCF-first reminders).
- Retake pathway: targeted re-teach + alternate final section.

## Enrichment
- Conceptual intro to completing the square (optional, no heavy technique).

## Parent Notes
- Common pitfall: dropping the negative sign when setting factors to zero.
- Quick win: require “set each factor = 0” as an explicit written step.

## Recordkeeping
- Save final exam, project report, presentation notes, and final reflection.
