# Learning Outcomes & Assessment

## Outcomes design
Each program defines outcomes mapped to:
- assignments
- projects
- exams (if any)

## Assessment quality
- rubrics required for graded work
- explainability required for AI-supported evaluation
- appeals pathway required for disputed outcomes

## Continuous improvement
Quarterly: review aggregate performance + adjust curriculum.
