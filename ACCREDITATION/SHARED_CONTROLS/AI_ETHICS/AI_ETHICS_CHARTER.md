# AI Ethics Charter (Institutional)

**Effective Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Owner:** AI Governance Lead  
**Review Cadence:** Annual (or after major incident)

## 1. Purpose
SydTek deploys AI in education to augment learning, not replace human accountability.
All AI use must preserve dignity, safety, fairness, and student rights.

## 2. Non-Negotiables
1. **Human Accountability:** A named human owner is accountable for every AI system.
2. **No Deceptive AI:** AI must be clearly labeled as AI in all student interactions.
3. **Student Welfare First:** AI must not manipulate or coerce student behavior.
4. **Privacy by Design:** No unnecessary collection; no PII on public chains.
5. **Fairness:** AI must be tested for bias; disparities trigger mitigation.
6. **Explainability:** Students can request human-readable rationale for AI-influenced outcomes.
7. **Safety Controls:** Moderation, escalation, and incident response are mandatory.
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Audits and drift monitoring are required.

## 3. Mirror → Water → Fire Alignment (Institutional Interpretation)
- **Mirror (Truth & Traceability):** logs, citations, disclosure, audit trails
- **Water (Purification & Care):** bias mitigation, privacy, accessibility, consent
- **Fire (Accountability & Action):** enforcement, escalation, human override, remediation

## 4. Governance
- Ethics Board reviews high-impact systems quarterly.
- Any severe incident triggers a 72-hour preliminary report and mitigation plan.

## 5. Enforcement
Violations may result in suspension of systems, credential invalidation, or platform bans, as appropriate.
