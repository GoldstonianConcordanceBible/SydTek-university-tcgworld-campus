# Platform Dependency & Continuity Plan

## Goal
If a platform becomes unavailable, SydTek must preserve:
- student records
- course materials
- credential proofs
- safety logs (where needed)

## Minimum continuity capabilities
- export gradebooks and transcripts
- export course content
- export audit logs (Tier 3 AI + moderation)
- alternative delivery plan (video + downloadable packets)

## Metaverse continuity
If metaverse access is disrupted:
- instruction continues via LMS
- metaverse activities become optional enrichment
- no grades rely solely on metaverse presence unless equivalent alternative exists

## Review cadence
Quarterly check: export capability test (sample).
