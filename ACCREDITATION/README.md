# Accreditation Vault (Audit-Ready)
This folder is the institutional evidence vault for:
- **SydTek Scholars (K–12)**: Judeo-Christian private accredited online homeschool
- **SydTek University**: Online + metaverse campus (TCG World implementation)

## What this vault is
A structured set of policies, procedures, templates, and evidence crosswalks aligned to common accreditation review expectations:
- Mission & identity clarity
- Governance and accountability
- Academic quality, assessment, and integrity
- Student safety and safeguarding
- AI ethics, privacy, and transparency
- Continuous improvement

## How to use
1. Start with `/ACCREDITATION/EVIDENCE_INDEX/EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`
2. Ensure every policy has: **Owner, Review cadence, Version, Effective date**
3. Maintain evidence artifacts in the same folder as the policy (or link to them)

## Evidence principles
- **Traceable**: Every claim links to a policy and evidence artifact
- **Reviewable**: Human review exists for high-impact decisions
- **Transparent**: AI is disclosed; student rights and consent are clear
- **Safe**: safeguarding rules are enforceable in online + metaverse spaces
