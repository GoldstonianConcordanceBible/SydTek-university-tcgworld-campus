# Incident Response — Campus Content Integrity

## What counts as an incident?
- Fabricated citations/anchors discovered
- Harmful or coercive content reported
- Credential issuance error
- Plagiarism allegation
- Broken evidence pointers that undermine credentials

## Immediate actions
1. Remove or disable the affected content in-world if possible
2. Open a Credential Issue or Bug Report
3. Preserve evidence: links, screenshots, hashes
4. Assign reviewer(s) and maintainer

## Resolution actions
- Correct content with a documented change
- Add a correction note in release notes
- If necessary: revoke or reissue credential with reason code

## Communication
- Keep messages factual
- No blame language
- Document what changed and why

## Post-incident improvement
- Add a test prompt to the NPC test bank
- Add a governance gate if the failure revealed a gap
