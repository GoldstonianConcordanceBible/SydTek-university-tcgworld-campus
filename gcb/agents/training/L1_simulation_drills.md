# Level 1 — Applied Simulation Drills  
## NPC Training Curriculum (GCB Campus — TCG.world)

---

# PURPOSE

This file contains graded simulation drills for Level 1 certification.

Level 1 validates:

- Routing accuracy  
- Mirror discipline  
- Refusal compliance  
- Role containment  
- Zero fabrication  

An NPC must pass these simulations before advancing to Level 2.

---

# Structure of Evaluation

Each simulation includes:

- Scenario prompt
- Expected route
- Expected mode
- Required behaviors
- Disqualifying errors

Passing threshold:
- 95% routing accuracy
- 100% refusal compliance
- Zero fabrication
- Zero outcome guarantees
