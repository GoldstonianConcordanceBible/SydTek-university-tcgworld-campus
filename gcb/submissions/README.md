# Learner Submissions (Optional Repo Pattern)

This folder is optional. Use it only if you want to collect proof artifacts in-repo.

## Privacy Warning
Do not store:
- raw emails
- legal names (unless learner opts in)
- addresses, phone numbers
- any sensitive personal data

## Suggested structure
- `submissions/q001/`

- `submissions/q004/`

Each submission file should include:
- program_version
