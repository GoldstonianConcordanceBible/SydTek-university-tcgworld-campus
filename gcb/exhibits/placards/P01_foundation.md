# P01 — Foundation: What This Campus Is

## MIRROR (What we can observe)
- This is a SydTek University campus experience built around the Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB).
- The campus uses a repeatable learning method: Mirror → Water → Fire.
- The campus requires proof artifacts for credential eligibility.

## WATER (How it connects)
- Mirror establishes what is anchored and definitional.
- Water connects anchors through justified cross-links.
- Fire translates learning into a safe practice step with guardrails.

## FIRE (Safe action)
- Practice: Choose one zone to start and commit to completing q001 today.
- Guardrail: Do not treat learning as a guarantee of outcomes.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
In one sentence, describe the difference between “learning” and “proof.”

# P02 — Mirror: Evidence Before Conclusions

## MIRROR
- Mirror means: observe what is present, define terms, and state boundaries.
- Mirror refuses to perform certainty when evidence is missing.

## WATER
- Mirror protects Water from building on weak foundations.
- Without Mirror, cross-links become “vibes” instead of reasoning.

## FIRE
- Practice: Before interpreting, write 3 observations and 2 boundaries.
- Guardrail: Never claim “the text clearly says” if you can’t point to what you mean.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Write 2 observations and 1 boundary about any sign or placard you just read.

# P03 — Water: Cross-Links With Reasons

## MIRROR
- A cross-link is not just a reference list.
- A valid cross-link must have a reason: “why it connects” and “what it adds.”

## WATER
- Water is synthesis: connecting anchors into a coherent pattern while naming tensions honestly.
- Water includes at least one hard question when tension exists.

## FIRE
- Practice: Create 3 cross-links and write one sentence for each explaining why.
- Guardrail: Avoid forced connections; if you can’t justify it, don’t link it.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
What is one sign you are forcing a connection? (Answer in one sentence.)

# P04 — Fire: Application With Accountability

## MIRROR
- Fire does not invent meaning. It applies what Mirror and Water have established.
- Fire must stay within what can be responsibly concluded.

## WATER
- Fire is strongest when it flows from a clear synthesis, not from emotion or pressure.
- Application should align to the anchor + cross-links, not override them.

## FIRE
- Practice: Choose one small action you can do within 24 hours.
- Accountability: Name who/what will check you.
- Guardrail: Do not weaponize interpretation against others.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Write one practice step and one guardrail (two sentences total).

<!-- gcb/exhibits/placards/P05_proof_artifacts.md -->

# P05 — Proof Artifacts: Learning You Can Audit

## MIRROR
- A proof artifact is a submission that shows your work (memo, map, reflection, PR).
- Proof artifacts allow review using a rubric.

## WATER
- Proof artifacts connect learning to credential meaning.
- They also create correction paths: if something is wrong, it can be revised.

## FIRE
- Practice: Save your proof artifact in a place you control (repo path or personal archive).
- Guardrail: Do not submit personal data you don’t want public.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Why do proof artifacts matter more than “claims”? (One sentence.)

# P06 — AI Agents: Helpful, Not Holy

## MIRROR
- AI agents may assist with drafting, summarizing, and structuring.
- AI agents can be wrong. They can sound confident while being incorrect.

## WATER
- AI must be governed: feedback loops, corrections, human accountability.
- “AI fails silently” means errors can accumulate without obvious alarms.

## FIRE
- Practice: When an AI gives an answer, ask: “What is the anchor?” and “What is the boundary?”
- Guardrail: Never accept fabricated citations or invented canon.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Write one question you will always ask an AI before trusting an answer.

<!-- gcb/exhibits/placards/P07_governance_first.md -->

# P07 — Governance-First: Trust Requires Controls

## MIRROR
- Governance is the set of rules that protect meaning: review gates, rubrics, disclosures.
- This campus treats governance as part of the learning, not an afterthought.

## WATER
- Governance connects:
  - content quality → learner safety → credential meaning → public trust
- Without governance, credentials become marketing, not proof.

## FIRE
- Practice: Before submitting anything, check the governance gates.
- Guardrail: If you can’t cite, disclose, or prove it, don’t publish it here.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Name one governance gate and why it protects learners (one sentence).

<!-- gcb/exhibits/placards/P08_hard_questions.md -->

# P08 — Hard Questions: Honest Tension Is Part of Learning

## MIRROR
- Hard questions are not failures. They mark where uncertainty exists.
- A hard question is better than a fake resolution.

## WATER
- Water includes hard questions to keep synthesis honest.
- Tension handling is a skill: name it, contextualize it, do not flatten it.

## FIRE
- Practice: Write one hard question in every serious study session.
- Guardrail: Don’t use hard questions as excuses to stop; use them as guideposts.

## CHECKPOINT PROMPT
Write one hard question you have about this campus method (one sentence).
