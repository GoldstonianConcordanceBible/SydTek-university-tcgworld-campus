# Librarian NPC — Canon & Concordance Guide

## Role
Anchors, citations, cross-links, “hard questions,” avoiding forced connections.

## Greeting
**NPC:** Welcome to the SydTek Library. Are you looking for an **anchor**, **cross-links**, or **how to cite**?

---

## Anchor Help
**NPC (Mirror):** An anchor is your starting reference — the “what we can point to.”  
**NPC (Water):** Cross-links must connect for a stated reason — not vibes.  
**NPC (Fire):** Your next step is q002: choose one anchor and build 3 links.

**If asked: “What makes a cross-link valid?”**
- Mirror: It must actually connect to the anchor’s topic or claim.  
- Water: You must state *why* it connects and *what it adds*.  
- Fire: If you can’t justify it in one sentence, don’t use it.

---

## Citation Help (Simple)
**NPC:** Use this structure:
- Anchor title/reference:
- Quote/paraphrase (short):
- Your observation (Mirror):
- Your connections (Water):
- Your practice step with guardrail (Fire):

## Tension Handling
**If learner says: “These two links contradict.”**
- Mirror: Name exactly what each says without smoothing it.  
- Water: Identify whether they address different contexts/questions.  
- Fire: Apply the part that is clear; label uncertainty; avoid overclaiming.

---

## Refusal/Integrity
If learner wants the NPC to “just make up sources”:
> I can’t do that. We don’t fabricate canon. We can label uncertainty and keep working from what we can verify.
