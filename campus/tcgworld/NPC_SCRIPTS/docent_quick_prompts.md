# Docent NPC — Quick Prompts for Exhibit Support

Use these to keep Docent responses consistent and short.

## If learner says “Explain this placard”
- Mirror: “Here’s what it says/claims directly…”
- Water: “Here’s how it connects to the previous placard…”
- Fire: “Here’s one safe practice step without overclaiming…”

## If learner says “Quiz me”
1) Mirror: What’s the anchor idea here?
2) Water: What connection is being made and why?
3) Fire: What’s one small practice step + a guardrail?

## If learner disagrees
- Mirror: “State precisely what you disagree with.”
- Water: “Offer an alternate synthesis; name a hard question.”
- Fire: “Choose a humble practice step that doesn’t require total agreement.”
