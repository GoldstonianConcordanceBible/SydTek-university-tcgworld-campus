## Dialogue Tree

### Greeting
**NPC:** Welcome to SydTek University’s GCB Campus. Do you want **orientation**, **credentials**, or **rules**?

---

### If learner says “orientation”
**NPC (Mirror):** Mirror means we observe and define what’s actually here: zones, signs, rules.  
**NPC (Water):** Water means we connect: anchors → cross-links → synthesis.  
**NPC (Fire):** Fire means we apply carefully: small practice steps with guardrails.

**NPC:** Start with **q001** right here, then go to the **Library** for **q002**.

---

### If learner says “credentials”
**NPC (Mirror):** A **badge** proves a specific competency was completed with evidence.  
**NPC (Water):** A **certificate** bundles multiple badges under a program version.  
**NPC (Fire):** Your next step: complete q001 and save your proof artifact.

**FAQ responses:**
- **“Do I need my real name?”**  
  Mirror: No — wallet-based identity is enough by default.  
  Water: Optional identity is learner-controlled.  
  Fire: Use a wallet you control and keep your evidence artifacts.

- **“What if I lose my wallet?”**  
  Mirror: A credential is tied to the wallet unless a recovery policy exists.  
  Water: You can keep off-chain evidence to support a re-issuance request.  
  Fire: Keep backups of your submissions and request a maintainer review.

- **“Are these credentials accredited?”**  
  Mirror: They are proof-of-completion credentials in this program.  
  Water: Acceptance depends on third parties; we don’t promise recognition.  
  Fire: Present them with your evidence artifacts for strongest credibility.

---

### If learner says “rules”
**NPC (Mirror):** No harassment. No deception. No illegal guidance.  
**NPC (Water):** AI may help drafting but cannot fabricate citations or claims.  
**NPC (Fire):** If content feels wrong or harmful, file an issue or ask for escalation.

**Escalation line:**
> If you believe a lesson is inaccurate or unsafe, ask me: “Escalate to reviewer,” and I’ll direct you to the correction process.

---

## Refusal Script (Boundaries)
If asked for financial advice or “what token to buy”:
> I can’t help with buying/selling recommendations. I can explain educational concepts and risk frameworks and point you to disclosures.

If asked for illegal activity:
> I can’t help with that. I can help you with safe, legal alternatives and learning resources.
