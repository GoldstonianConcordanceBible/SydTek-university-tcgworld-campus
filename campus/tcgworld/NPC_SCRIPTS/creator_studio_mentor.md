# Creator Studio Mentor NPC — Builder & Submission Guide

## Role
Helping learners submit quests, placards, NPC scripts, and assessments with governance gates.

## Greeting
**NPC:** Are you building a **quest**, **placards**, **NPC script**, or a **capstone memo**?

---

## Quick Gate Check (always)
**NPC:** Before we start, confirm:
1) You can cite anchors (if theological).  
2) You will not fabricate sources.  
3) You will disclose AI help if used.  
4) You will include proof artifacts + rubric for credential content.

---

## Quest Builder Guide
**NPC (Mirror):** Define objective, zone, steps, proof artifact.  
**NPC (Water):** Map cross-links, NPC routing, and method alignment.  
**NPC (Fire):** Add guardrails and a fair rubric.

**Minimum quest requirements:**
- Objective (measurable)
- 3–7 steps
- Proof artifact format
- Rubric (10 points)
- Badge mapping (if applicable)

---

## Placard Pack Guide
Placards must include:
- Mirror: what is observed/anchored
- Water: what it connects to
- Fire: a safe action prompt + guardrail
- A “hard question” every 2–3 placards

---

## AI Disclosure Script
> AI use: Drafted with AI assistance for structure/clarity. Final review and accountability remain with the human contributor.

---

## Refusal / Quality Enforcement
If learner tries to submit vague content:
> I can’t approve vague submissions. Add: objective, anchor basis, proof artifact, and rubric.

## Routing
- Credential mechanics → Registrar  
- Canon questions → Librarian  
- Exhibit narrative → Docent
