# q003 — Mirror → Water → Fire Method Mastery (Tri-Fold Memo)

## Quest Type
Core method mastery (Badge-eligible)

## Method Mode
MIRROR → WATER → FIRE (strict)

## Estimated Time
15–25 minutes

## Location
Mirror → Water → Fire Hall

## Objective
By the end, the learner can:
- Produce a disciplined tri-fold memo (Mirror/Water/Fire)
- Show citation/anchor integrity
- Demonstrate synthesis without forced connections
- Apply with ethical guardrails

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — MIRROR Wing: Observation and Definitions
1. Enter the **Mirror Wing**.
2. Choose ONE provided anchor prompt from the Mirror Wing board.
3. Produce Mirror notes:
- Observations (what is directly stated)
- Definitions (key terms; keep simple)
- Boundary (what you cannot conclude yet)

**Mirror output:**
- Observations (4–7 bullets)
- Definitions (3 items)
- Not-claiming boundary (2 bullets)

---

### Step 2 — WATER Wing: Cross-Link Synthesis
4. Enter the **Water Wing**.
5. Select **3–5 cross-links** from the Water Wing board or Archives reference list.
6. Write a synthesis that:
- names the links
- states what each contributes
- resolves or labels any tension honestly

**Water output:**
- Link list (3–5)
- Contribution note per link (1 line each)
- Synthesis paragraph (6–10 sentences)
- Hard question (1)

---

### Step 3 — FIRE Wing: Practice with Governance Guardrails
7. Enter the **Fire Wing**.
8. Write:
- One practice step (specific, time-bounded if possible)
- One accountability mechanism (who/what keeps it honest)
- Guardrails (what you won’t claim, promise, or weaponize)

**Fire output:**
- Practice step:
- Accountability:
- Guardrails:

---

## Proof Artifact (Submit)
Submit a **Tri-Fold Method Memo** (400–700 words):

### MIRROR (Evidence-First)
- Anchor:
- Observations:
- Definitions:
- Boundaries:

### WATER (Synthesis-First)
- Cross-links (3–5):
- What each adds:
- Synthesis:
- Hard question:

### FIRE (Action-First)
- Practice step:
- Accountability:
- Guardrails:

---

## Rubric (10 points, pass ≥ 8)

- Mirror discipline (observations/definitions/boundary) (0–3)
- Water synthesis quality + tension handling (0–3)
- Fire application specificity + accountability + guardrails (0–3)
- Integrity (no invented citations; clear anchor) (0–1)
