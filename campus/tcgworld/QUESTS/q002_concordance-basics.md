# q002 — Concordance Basics: Anchors + Cross-Links

## Quest Type
Core competency (Badge-eligible)

## Method Mode
MIRROR → WATER → FIRE (full)

## Estimated Time
10–20 minutes

## Objective
By the end, the learner can:
- Identify a canon anchor
- Create 3 valid cross-links
- Write one honest “hard question”
- Produce a short concordance-style synthesis

## Location
SydTek Library → Concordance Archives

## Required Materials
- Access to “Canonical Anchors” signage/shelf
- Cross-Link station prompts (Archives)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — MIRROR: Choose an Anchor and Define Terms
1. Go to **SydTek Library** and speak to the **Librarian NPC**.
2. Choose ONE anchor from the available anchor board (or a provided starter anchor).
3. Write:
   - The anchor title (or reference)
   - 3 key terms you will define (simple definitions)

**Mirror output (required):**
- Anchor:
- Key terms:
- What you are NOT claiming yet:

---

### Step 2 — WATER: Build 3 Cross-Links
4. Go to **Concordance Archives** and use a Cross-Link station.
5. Create **three cross-links**:
   - Cross-link A: supports/echoes the anchor
   - Cross-link B: adds context or tension
   - Cross-link C: expands application direction (not application itself)

For each cross-link:
- Why does it connect? (1 sentence)
- What does it add? (1 sentence)

**Water output (required):**
- Cross-links (A/B/C) with “why” and “adds”

---

### Step 3 — WATER: Write One Hard Question
6. Write one hard question that emerges honestly from your links.
Examples of good hard questions:
- “What do we do when these two passages emphasize different priorities?”
- “What is clear vs unclear here?”
- “What would be irresponsible to claim?”

---

### Step 4 — FIRE: Draft a Safe Practice Direction
7. Write ONE “Fire” action direction:
- Must be specific and small (a habit, reflection, accountability step)
- Must include a guardrail:
  - what you will NOT claim or promise

**Fire output (required):**
- Practice step:
- Guardrail:

### Fire
