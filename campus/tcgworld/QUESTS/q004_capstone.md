## Choose ONE Capstone Path

### Path A — Publishable Contribution (Preferred)
Submit one of the following as a PR:

1) A new quest (q005+), OR  
2) A placard set (8–12 placards) for Exhibit Walkthrough, OR  
3) An NPC script pack (new NPC + routing + guardrails), OR  
4) A lesson plan + assessment aligned to Mirror/Water/Fire.

**Acceptance requirement:** PR must be merged after review.

### Path B — Capstone Memo (If not contributing)
Submit a long-form capstone memo that demonstrates mastery.

**Acceptance requirement:** reviewer pass with rubric ≥ 8/10.

## Steps (Both Paths)

### Step 1 — MIRROR: Define the Artifact
1. State exactly what you are submitting.
2. Identify:
- intended learner outcome
- anchor(s) used (if theological)
- boundaries (what you will NOT claim)

### Step 2 — WATER: Connect to Campus Systems
3. Map your artifact to:
- which zone it belongs in
- which NPC routes to it
- which badge/certificate it supports (if any)
4. Show cross-links (at least 3) OR rationale for why cross-links are not applicable.

### Step 3 — FIRE: Application + Proof
5. State:
- how learners will apply it
- what proof artifact they submit
- what guardrails prevent harm or overreach

## Proof Artifact (Submit)

### If Path A (PR)
Submit:
- PR link (or repo path)
- short summary (150–250 words)

- attribution list (sources, inspirations)

### If Path B (Memo)
Submit:
- 800–1200 word capstone memo in tri-fold format
- includes rubric self-check
- includes disclosures acknowledgement
