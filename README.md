# Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB) — SydTek University Campus for TCG.world

This repository contains the world design, learning experiences, governance, and on-chain credentialing framework for the **SydTek University metaverse campus** inside **TCG.world**, centered around the **Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB)**.

## What this repo is
- A **builder’s blueprint** for deploying the GCB experience in a metaverse campus:
  - zones, quests, NPC scripts, and exhibit placards

- An **on-chain credential layer** (badges + certificate metadata specs)
- A **governance layer** (content quality controls and contributor rules)

## Campus zones (TCG.world)
- **Spawn Hub** — orientation + safety + “how to navigate”
- **SydTek Library** — curated reading + canonical anchors
- **Concordance Archives** — cross-links, index browsing, search rituals
- **Mirror → Water → Fire Hall** — doctrine walk-through experience
- **Lecture Theater** — talks, live classes, and release events
