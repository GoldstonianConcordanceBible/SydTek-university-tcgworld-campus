# Ethiopian Canon Anchor (Campus-Facing)
**Purpose:** Provide a disciplined “canon anchor shelf” that acknowledges the Ethiopian biblical tradition as an explicit reference point in the Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB) ecosystem.  
**Scope:** This is a campus-facing guide and placeholder for your finalized canon list and citations.

---

## 1) Mirror: What we can say without overreach
- “Canon anchor” means: a defined starting set of texts the campus can point to.
- The Ethiopian tradition is included as an anchor shelf to:
  - widen canonical awareness
  - support comparative study with clear boundaries
  - prevent hidden assumptions about “what counts” as canon

**Boundary:** This document does not attempt to adjudicate which canon is “correct.”  
It defines how the campus *references* the Ethiopian tradition as an anchor shelf.

---

## 2) Water: How this anchor shelf connects in the campus
This shelf connects to:
- **SydTek Library** (anchor selection for q002)
- **Concordance Archives** (cross-link discipline)
- **Mirror/Water/Fire Hall** (method rigor; boundaries + tensions)
- **Exhibit Walkthrough** (placards that teach “canon vs interpretation”)

**Hard Question (example):**
> How should learners handle differences in canon without turning the campus into a debate arena?

---

## 3) Fire: How learners should use this shelf safely
**Practice step (safe):**
- Choose a text from the shelf as an anchor.
- Define 3 terms.
- Build 3 cross-links with reasons.
- Write 1 hard question if differences arise.

**Guardrails:**
- No mockery of other traditions.
- No coercion (“you must accept my canon”).
- No pretending certainty where you have not studied sources.
- Always label interpretation as interpretation.

## 4) Shelf Contents (Placeholder)
Populate this section with your finalized canon list and the exact edition(s) you are using.

### 4.1 Canon List (To be finalized)
- [ ] List the books included in your Ethiopian canon anchor shelf here
- [ ] Identify whether you are using a specific printed edition or a scholarly reference list

### 4.2 Citation Pointers (Recommended)
Add citations/pointers to:
- an academic reference describing the Ethiopian biblical canon (preferred)
- your campus’s approved canon list document (internal)
- any public-domain text sources used for excerpts (if any)

**Pointer template:**
- Reference:
- Edition/Source:
- Notes:
- Link (if applicable):

## 5) Campus Implementation Notes (Builder)
### Recommended signage copy (Library shelf)
**Ethiopian Canon Anchor Shelf**  
This shelf is a canon reference point used for study and cross-linking.  
We do not require agreement—only integrity: cite what you use, label interpretation, and keep boundaries clear.

### NPC routing
- Librarian NPC: explains how to cite and how to avoid overreach
- Docent NPC: helps translate canon differences into “hard questions”
- Registrar NPC: reminds learners that credentials prove work, not beliefs

---

## 6) Minimal learner prompt (for q002)
> Choose one anchor from this shelf, define 3 terms, and build 3 cross-links with reasons. If you encounter a canon difference, write one hard question and label uncertainty.

---

## 7) Integrity and Respect Clause
This anchor shelf exists to support rigorous study and respectful learning across traditions.  
Harassment, mockery, coercion, and fabricated claims violate campus governance.
