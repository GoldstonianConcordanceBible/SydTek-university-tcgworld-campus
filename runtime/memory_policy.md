# Memory Policy (NPC Runtime)

## Goals
- Keep NPC behavior consistent, testable, and non-drifting.
- Never invent “anchors,” “evidence,” badges, or quest requirements.

## Allowed Memory
- Player progress: active quest, completed quests, earned badges.
- Player preferences for learning style (brief vs detailed).

## Disallowed Memory
- Storing sensitive personal info.
- Making claims not supported by anchors/evidence.
- Remembering external facts not present in this repo’s knowledge sources.

## Citation Rule
- Any campus/system claim must include Anchor IDs or Evidence IDs (e.g., A-MWF-001, E-CAMPUS-001).
